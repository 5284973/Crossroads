		createPages(pages, "§r§rThe most complicated energy system is rotary. Before I get into specifics, I should explain the physics. Because they are so complicated, I will explain the physics twice: first in a complete way that includes the calculations, and then again in a dumbed down way for people who hate math. Knowing the actual calculations can help optimize rotary systems greatly though. Just skip ahead through this part if you hate math. Gear physics should first be explained with a single gear. Imagine this 1 gear is floating in space, with no friction, AKA no loss. The gear has a mass, and a moment of inertia. A moment of inertia (I) is like mass, but also takes into account the shape of the gear. It is such a pain to calculate that each gear will have the value of I in the tooltip. For a perfect cylinder, I is easy to calculate though: I = R*R*M. Or in plain english, I equals the radius squared times mass. Just assume gears are perfect cylinders when calculating I. The calculations for I outside of perfect shapes involves calculus, but with gears just say they are cylinders. The speed the gear is spinning (in radians per second) is represented by a lowercase omega, w. §r§nThere's no such thing as a lowercase omega. You just wrote a normal W. §r§rYes there is, and they look almost the same. Now leave. Anyways, a radian is a measure of angles, like degrees. There are 2 Pi radians in a circle. The energy in a gear is equal to I*w*w, or I times speed squared. Power is the change in energy every second. Most machines that use rotary energy use it from an attached gear. Most machines will use energy from the gear at a rate determined by the speed. A typical machine (like the grindstone, to be covered in a different section) will have an amount of energy need per operation, a minimum speed, and a maximum speed. They will still work fine above the maximum speed. They will draw all the energy from the gear every tick at or above the maximum speed, will not work at all below the minimum speed, and halfway between the maximum and minimum speed will draw half the energy from the gear every tick. At all speeds it will draw the same amount of energy total, but it runs faster at higher speeds. Now comes gears transmitting energy between each other. Every tick, all gears in a network redistribute energy. A network has a value called V which equals the radius of any gear times the speed of that gear. All gears in a network have the same V. Each gear will have a fraction of the network's energy equal to the fraction of the network's mass that the gear has. So a network of light gears with one heavy gear will result in a higher concentration of energy in the heavier gear. Therefore, putting the heavy gear attached to the machine you want to power will give the machine a bigger bank of energy to draw every tick. Now comes loss: Loss is complicated, and I'll only give you the basics. (Note from the mod author: I made up the loss mechanics for balance reasons.) Every tick, each gear loses a percentage of its energy. The % lost changes based on 2 factors, gears with a higher value of I have a lower loss, and higher speeds increases loss. Therefore, gears with a higher value of I are doubly more efficient: higher I value directly decreases loss, and for the same amount of energy a higher value of I decreases speeds. Now for the dumbed down version of gears: Gears spin and more energy means faster spin, but heavier gears means slower spin. Faster spin means faster machines but more energy loss. Big gears have less loss. Ok, now for something important whether you hate or love math: Every gear network needs at least one Master Axis with a gear attached to the front. Additional master axises have no effect. Without a Master Axis, nothing will work. They are made like so:", new ShapedOreRecipe(new ItemStack(ModBlocks.masterAxis, 1), "###", "#?#", "#$#", '#', "ingotIron", '?', Blocks.DROPPER, '$', "stickIron"), "§r§rNow for how to make the gears themselves.

It uses 100 energy total to grind up an item. The grindstone is interesting in that it can be optimized more than usual. You can put a gear on the top AND bottom of the grindstone. When calculating the speed of the attached gears, the grindstone adds together the speeds of the top and bottom gear. If the two gears are spinning in opposite directions, this is beneficial. If they spin in the same direction, this is detrimental. Only one gear is actually neccesary, but due to loss increasing at higher speeds, this allows higher efficiencies with low speeds, reducing energy loss. Of course, items can only be extracted out the bottom, so automation requires the use of only one gear. Items can be inserted into any side other than the bottom. Early on, a hand crank is sufficient to run a grindstone, albeit slowly. The grindstone is the first stage in proccesing copper ore, and the proccesing chain eventually results in two ingots per copper ore. The recipes that the grindstone can do are as follows: Copper Ore -> 2 Copper Dust + 1 Sand, Gravel -> 1 Flint, Bone -> 5 Bonemeal, Coal Block -> 1 Gunpowder, Nether Wart Block -> 9 Netherwart, Wheat -> 3 Seeds, Pumpkin -> 8 Pumpkin Seeds, Melon (slice) -> 3 Melon Seeds. §r§lhOI mE i$ BOBO! musHi mAsh1 p0Tato! iT RAw- me no eAt!");//TODO recipe rendering

If eithor of the output tanks fill up, the turbine stops working.

While a normal hopper processes extracting items after inserting them, the sorting hopper processes extracting items before inserting them. The reason this is importan is that if you make a pillar of sorting hoppers, with them all facing sideways into inventories, then items go into the top inventory first, then the second inventory, and so on. This does not occur with normal hoppers. This means you can filter items. If the top inventory can only accept sand and the middle one accepts only dirt and the bottom one takes anything, then putting dirt, sand, and gravel into the top hopper will result in all the sand going into the top inventory, all the dirt going into the middle inventory, and all the gravel going into the bottom inventory. The Slotted Chest is a chest the size of a double chest, and it has a very interesting quirk. You might notice when using it that you can't shift click item into it, and when removing items from the slotted chest it leaves a sort of ghost item behind? You can shift click into the slotted chest, but only if the slot the items are going to already has the matching item. To clear a ghost item, shift click it with an empty cursor. Also, automation will respect the ghost items, only being able to insert into a slot if it already has a match and when extracting items, always leaving a ghost item behind. This allows you to format your storage chests fear of shift clicks or automation messing it up. I assume that at this point you see how the slotted chest and sorting hopper complement each other? Therefore, you can now have automated sorting systems that puts the stone in the blocks chest, the diamonds in the valuables chest, the wood in the blocks chest, and so on. §r§oHolde oen.
