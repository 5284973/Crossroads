# Crossroads
Currently in early stages, and not released yet. 
A WIP tech & magic mod (magic NYI) for Minecraft with the intention of making the player think through their designs instead of just whacking down a pulverizer next to a redstone furnace with a solar panel powering them and thinking they've done a good job automating ore proccesing, and so on.




Required coding style for commits:
use tabs over spaces.
put the { on the same line, but the } on a new line.
